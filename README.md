# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Class Application in React

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are inconsistently applied in a React project.  The problem is that some classes are ignored, while others work as expected, even though the configuration and imports seem correct. 

The `bug.js` file shows the initial code with the issue, and `bugSolution.js` provides a solution that fixes the inconsistent application of Tailwind CSS classes.

## Setup:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
