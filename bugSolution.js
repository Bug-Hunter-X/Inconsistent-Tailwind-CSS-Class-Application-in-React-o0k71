The issue was resolved by ensuring that the Tailwind directives were correctly placed within the CSS file and that the build process correctly included all Tailwind styles.  The problematic code was likely due to incorrect usage of the `@tailwind` directives within the `tailwind.css` file.  By ensuring all styles were included, and the purge option was appropriately configured, the issue was fixed. I have also added stricter linting rules to catch such errors in the future.  
Here's the corrected code: 
```javascript
// ... other imports
import '../styles/tailwind.css'; // Ensure correct import path

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
      Hello world!
    </div>
  );
}
```
The solution also involved double-checking that the `tailwind.config.js` was correctly set up to include all the necessary paths.
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ // Ensure this includes all relevant files
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
